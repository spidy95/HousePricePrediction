# House Price Prediction
> 

### Introduction:
This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the sale price of houses based on various predictor variables. This readme file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and important information about the dataset and model evaluation.

### Dataset:
The dataset used for house price prediction contains information about different features of houses such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. It is important to note that the dataset is for educational and demonstration purposes only and may not reflect real-world data.

### Project Structure:
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: This directory stores the trained models generated during the project.

### Code Execution:
To run the code and reproduce the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/spidy95/HousePricePrediction.git
Install the required dependencies listed in the import section of notebook
Place the dataset file in the data/ directory.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory and execute the cells sequentially.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Model Evaluation:
The performance of the house price prediction model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and others. These metrics provide insights into how well the model fits the data and its predictive capabilities.
